In this project, we aim to explore how the range of a projectile depends on the launch angle , both: Analytically (using kinematic and dynamic equations), Numerically (using Python simulations with and without air resistance). We'll begin with the ideal case (no air resistance), and progressively consider more realistic scenarios involving linear air drag , wind , and computational modeling . 1. Equations of Motion Without Air Resistance We apply Newton\u2019s Second Law : \\[ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} \\] This leads to constant acceleration in the vertical direction and no horizontal acceleration. 2. With Air Resistance (Linear Drag) Air drag is modeled as a force proportional to the velocity: \\[ \\vec{F}_{\\text{drag}} = -k \\vec{v} \\] Horizontal Direction \\[ \\frac{dv_x}{dt} = -k v_x \\] Vertical Direction \\[ \\frac{dv_y}{dt} = -g - k v_y \\] These are first-order differential equations , typically solved using numerical methods such as Euler or Runge-Kutta . 3.
